        paragraph: "Yohannes has been a student of the Full Stack Web Development course (covering the MERN stack) at the Digital Career Institute (DCI) since 02.09.2021. I have been Yohannes’s lecturer since 10.02.2022, covering the “Single Page Application” and “Backend” course modules. From our time together, I am confident that Yohannes’s strong combination of technical skills and personal qualities will make him an asset in the web development industry. During our time together, Yohannes has been a highly engaged and constructive member of the class. Yohannes is a dedicated and inquisitive learner, who has demonstrated not only a passion for writing clean, technically proficient code, but also a drive to understand the principles behind the code he writes. Yohanes has consistently been a key contributor to class discussions, regularly demonstrating his strong understanding of the materials, as well as having the confidence to ask penetrating questions and contribute excellent insights of his own, without dominating the discussion."
